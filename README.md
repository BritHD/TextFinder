# Text Finder

This program searches for any string located in a target directory! This will search the targeted string in every file in your targeted directory. This will also list what extension your files are in the targeted directory

To use it yourself, download main.py and change the folder_path to your target directory you want to search in, and change search_string to the string you want to search for in all of your files.

Example: 
~~~
folder_path = /User/Home/Desktop/Folder_Target
search_string = 'apple'
~~~
